People always said, "don't stay up late." Meanwhile, teachers always assign lots of assignments and tests. That is ridiculous to sleep on time while making sure prepared for every test.

Some people said, "Why not do them in the morning?" Hard. I tried to wake up at 5 A.M, even the 4:30 A.M, I found it impossible sometimes to do all of the assignments. Whereas some people said, "Why not do them in breaking time, or the common one - after class?" Well, we are not always energetic. I prefer to take a nap after class. Meanwhile, we prefer the leisure activities to do them all in the whole after-class time. Our energy is limited, not unlimited. We are not a robot exactly.

So the only choice is to do them by staying up late.

I prefer to develop my learning way, for example, do a mindmap from the learning content. To maintain my learning way while completing the assignments and reports on time is slightly impossible. Especially the time when I was busying on my contests, it is pretty hard to maintain those four things in a row in ONE DAY.

The "Master Framework for the 12-year Basic Education Curriculum Guidelines" hopes us develop our capabilities whereas still assigning lots of homework. I thought we, in these guidelines, are thought as a robot.

Actually, I support the ideal milestones these guidelines want to reach, but it is too ideal. It should give us enough time to develop our capabilities, but it DIDN'T. If it had done it, I would have had the time to develop my hobbies with nothing disturbed me. It is still better than the old one in the result for me, though.
