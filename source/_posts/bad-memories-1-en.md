The story is mostly from [《我在網路上被霸凌和爆個資的日子》](http://blog.pan93.tk/bully/), which is my first article that was published here. In addition to these, I also added my recent mind to this. I will partially translate this to Chinese though it has been published somewhere.

These are mostly writing-as-I-thinking. Don't expect any structure in this article. I just note these events in English.

## Bulling From 4 Years Old

My parents told me that I've transferred to many schools when I am an elementary school student because of the bullies. According to my parents, not only the students but the teacher told me that I'm a freak just because I'm very bad at handling social.

For example, when everyone discussing the cartoon they watched yesterday, I always said something computer-related. Failed to be melted, I suffered the bullies.

Maybe I was Asperger syndrome (AS) before? I don't know. All I know is that I am still a loner until now.

## No Mercy for a 13-year-old Child

I was a kid (exactly a brat) then. For a kid, it is better to NOT bully him though it is annoying. Wounding a child will let a child hurt very much and irreversibly.

But a large number of the member in YSITD, a Telegram group, often attacked me with speech. They said to me, a 12-year-old kid, I'm the garbage that should NEVER be existed in the world.

Every time I share my discoveries, they said me "SHUT UP" almost every time. It made me afraid to express my thoughts now, since I am afraid to hear any "SHUT UP", "FUCK OFF" and "KILL YOURSELF".

## Identity Authentications (實名認證) are NOT Trustable

In addition to this, one of the YSITD members owned my personal information, such as my address, my phone number, my real name, and my identity card. He made some of them public, and said: "Shut the fuck up or I will share more." I, a 13-year-old boy, was afraid.

Until now, he never made an apology to me. All he gave me is the trauma. I thought the data source of those are from one of the service I authenticated.

I will never trust any Identity Authentication anymore.

## And now?

Sharing with some friends and teachers, I feel better now. Thanks to them who listened to my stories and gave me suggestions. But I am still afraid of those who engaged in the above events.

Until now, NONE of all the mentions above said "sorry" to me.
