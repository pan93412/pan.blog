As a developer that had tried out Solid, I would still prefer the mainstream tech stack in production. Solid.js' runtime is neat, while its performance is prominent. However, not many front-end utilities support it natively – for example, Storybook.

I encouraged people to try out new stuff in their hobby projects; however, I won't use them in production. I afraid the crucial components don't support this novel framework, and we may have to rewrite this front-end to another framework. That's boring and time-wasting.

BTW I'm not a omnipotent developer. I had attempted to contribute the Solid ecosystem – for ex., rewriting their transpiler module in Rust (SWC). It turned out that I was not familiar with the development under either Babel or SWC. So I gave up, and switched back to React soon.
