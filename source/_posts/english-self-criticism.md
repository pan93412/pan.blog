**I failed my English in the nutshell.** Feels pretty bad in this April fools day.

<!-- more -->

_Updated (4/1/2021): Math, English and Geography are ALL failed. I feel pretty bad._

Actually, I am shocked since I took a lot of time on every subject. Take English as an example, I took a lot of time to re-read every word, phrase, and sentence in my previous test papers, then extracted those I was not good at into my mindmap.

Generally, it will improve my English pretty lot and it indeed let me understand those words that I never figure out, but reading these papers and keying into my mind-map is also time-consumed work, and I don't have enough time to accommodate such a time monster.

And there is something that occupied my precious time VERY MUCH: "complete the All in One " - I should ignore All in One, place my mindmap project in the first, then finally complete All in One after I completed this exam. After all, All in One is not in my learning project.

The only thing I read completely is Lesson 2 in the textbook and a magazine. So I failed naturally, though I took very much time. Put this exam aside, it is a good habit though.

So I learned in this experience: "_Never try a new way to learn if time lacks_," and "_not every good habit takes effect immediately._" Maybe this good habit I could keep doing afterward, but for the important exam - **it is better to use the classical but stable way**.
